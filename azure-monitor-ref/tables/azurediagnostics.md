# AzureDiagnostics


Stores resource logs for Azure services that use Azure Diagnostics mode. Resource logs describe the internal operation of Azure resources.

The resource log for each Azure service has a unique set of columns. The AzureDiagnostics table includes the most common columns used by Azure services. If a resource log includes a column that doesn't already exist in the AzureDiagnostics table, that column is added the first time that data is collected. If the maximum number of 500 columns is reached, data for any additional columns is added to a dynamic column.

Azure services that use resource-specific mode store data in a table specific to that service and do not use the AzureDiagnostics table. See [Resource Types](#resource-types) below for the services that use each method. See [Azure resource logs](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/resource-logs#send-to-log-analytics-workspace) for details on the differences.

> [!NOTE]
> The AzureDiagnostics table is a custom log table created exclusively by the Azure Monitor pipeline the first time an Azure resource begins sending logs in Azure Diagnostics mode. Unlike other tables, the AzureDiagnostics table cannot be created via an ARM template or tables API. Consequently, modifying the table's default retention values before its creation is not possible.


## AdditionalFields column

Unlike other tables, **AzureDiagnostics** is much more susceptible to exceeding the 500 column limit imposed for any table in a Log Analytics workspace due to the wide assortment of Azure Resources capable of sending data to this table. To ensure that no data is lost due to the number of active columns exceeding this 500 column limit, AzureDiagnostics column creation is handled in a different manner to other tables.

The AzureDiagnostics table in every workspace will contain at a minimum the same [200 columns](#columns). For workspaces created before January 19, 2021, the table will also contain any columns that were already in place prior to this date. When data is sent to a column not already in place:

- If the total number of columns in **AzureDiagnostics** in the current workspace does not exceed 500, a new column will be created just like with any other table.
- If the total number of columns is at or above 500, the excess data is added to a dynamic property bag column called **AdditionalFields** as a property.

### Example

To illustrate this behavior, imagine that as of (deployment date) the AzureDiagnostics table in our workpsace looks as follows:

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | ... | Column 498 |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| abc | def | 123 | ... | 456 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

A resource that sends data to **AzureDiagnostics** then adds a new dimension to their data that they call **NewInfo1**. Since the table still has less than 500 columns, the first time an event occurs that contains data for this new dimension will add a new column to the table:

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | ... | Column 498 | NewInfo1_s |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| abc | def | 123 | ... | 456 | xyz |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

You can return this new data in a simple query:

```kusto
AzureDiagnostics | where NewInfo1_s == "xyz"
```

At a later date, another resource sends data to **AzureDiagnostics** that adds new dimensions called **NewInfo2** and **NewInfo3**. Because the table has reached 500 columns in this workspace, the new data will go into the **AdditionalFields** column:

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | ... | Column 498 | NewInfo1_s | AdditionalFields |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| abc | def | 123 | ... | 456 | xyz | {"NewInfo2":"789","NewInfo3":"qwerty"} |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

You can still query for this data,but you must extract it from the property bag using any of the dynamic property operators in KQL:

```kusto
AzureDiagnostics
| where AdditionalFields.NewInfo2 == "789" and AdditionalFields.NewInfo3 == "qwerty"
```

### Tips on using AdditionalFields column

While general query best practices such as always filtering by time as the first clause in the query should be followed, there are some other recommendations you should consider when working with AdditionalFields:

- You will need to typecast data prior to performing further operations on it. For example, if a column exists called **Perf1Sec_i** as well as a property in **AdditionalFields** called **Perf2Sec**, and you want to calculate total perf by adding both values, use something like: `AzureDiagnostics | extend TotalPerfSec = Perf1Sec_i + toint(AdditionalFields.Perf2Sec) | ....`.
- Use [where](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/whereoperator) clauses to reduce the data volume to the smallest possible prior to writing any complex logic to significantly improve performance. **TimeGenerated** is one column that should always be reduced to the smallest possible window. In the case of **AzureDiagnostics**, an additional filter should also always be included at the top of the query around the resource types that are being queried using the **ResourceType** column.
- When querying very large volumes of data, it is sometimes more efficient to do a filter on **AdditionalFields** as a whole rather than parsing it. For example, for large volumes of data `AzureDiagnostics | where AdditionalFields has "Perf2Sec"` is often more efficient than `AzureDiagnostics | where isnotnull(toint(AdditionalFields.Perf2Sec))`.

### Azure Diagnostics mode or resource-specific mode

The following services use either Azure diagnostics mode or resource-specific mode for their resource logs depending on their configuration. When they use resource-specific mode, they do not send data to the AzureDiagnostics table. See [Azure resource logs](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/resource-logs) for details on this configuration.
