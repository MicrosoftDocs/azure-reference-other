| CodeCacheBefore | long | Code cache before garbage collection (in bytes). Code cache stores native code generated by JVM. |
| Collections | int | The number of garbage collections. |
| CompressedClassSpaceAfter | long | Compressed class space after garbage collection (in bytes). Compressed class space stores class information referred to by the objects in the JavaHeap. |
| CompressedClassSpaceBefore | long | Compressed class space before garbage collection (in bytes). Compressed class space stores class information referred to by the objects in the JavaHeap. |
| DeletionInfo | string | Deletion info. |
| DroppedCrossNodeTimeout | int | The number of messages dropped due to cross node timeout in last 5000ms. |
| DroppedInternalTimeout | int | The number of messages dropped due to internal timeout in last 5000ms. |
| DroppedMessages | int | The number of messages dropped in last 5000ms. |
| DroppedMessagesType | string | The type of messages dropped in last 5000ms. |
| DurationMs | int | Duration. |
| EdenSpaceAfter | long | Eden space after garbage collection (in bytes). Eden space is the memory region where objects are allocated when they are created. |
| EdenSpaceBefore | long | Eden space before garbage collection (in bytes). Eden space is the memory region where objects are allocated when they are created. |
| Endpoint | string | IP address of an endpoint. |
| EventCategory | string | Category of the logging event, e.g. startup, garbage_collection, compaction. |
| EventProduct | string | Product of the logging event, e.g. cassandra, dse, solr. |
| EventType | string | type of the logging event, e.g. commit_log_replay_skipped, unknown_table. |
| Exception | string | Throwable trace bound to the logging event, by default this will output the full trace as one would normally find with a call to Throwable.printStackTrace(). |
| GCType | string | The type of garbage collection, e.g. ParNew, MarkSweepCompact, G1 Old. |
| HostId | string | The GUID assigned in the Cassandra cluster to uniquely identify this node. See the system.local table or nodetool status to find information about the host by its HostId. |
| _IsBillable | string | Specifies whether ingesting the data is billable. When _IsBillable is `false` ingestion isn't billed to your Azure account |

| PermGenAfter | long | Permanent Generation space after garbage collection (in bytes). Permanent generation stores classes metadata (renamed to Metaspace in Java 8). |
| PermGenBefore | long | Permanent Generation space before garbage collection (in bytes). Permanent generation stores classes metadata (renamed to Metaspace in Java 8). |
| RequestedColumns | int | The number of columns requested. |
| _ResourceId | string | A unique identifier for the resource that the record is associated with |
| SessionId | string | Unique string identifying what query was running when this log was emitted. Use SHOW SESSION \<SessionId\> to find details of the query's activity. |
| SliceEnd | string | The end of the the column slice inclusive. |
| SliceStart | string | The start of the column slice inclusive. |
| SourceFile | string | File name where the logging request was issued. |
| SourceLine | int | Line number where the logging request was issued. |
| SourceSystem | string | The type of agent the event was collected by. For example, `OpsManager` for Windows agent, either direct connect or Operations Manager, `Linux` for all Linux agents, or `Azure` for Azure Diagnostics |
| SSTableName | string | SSTable name. |
| _SubscriptionId | string | A unique identifier for the subscription that the record is associated with |
| SurvivorSpaceAfter | long | Survivor space after garbage collection (in bytes). Survivor space stores the objects that have survived the garbage collection of the Eden space. |
| SurvivorSpaceBefore | long | Survivor space before garbage collection (in bytes). Survivor space stores the objects that have survived the garbage collection of the Eden space. |
| TenantId | string | The Log Analytics workspace ID |
| ThreadId | string | ID of the thread that generated the logging event. |
