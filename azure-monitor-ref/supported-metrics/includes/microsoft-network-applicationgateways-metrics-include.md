|Metric|Name in REST API|Unit|Aggregation|Dimensions|Time Grains|DS Export|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Application Gateway Total Time**<p><p>Time that it takes for a request to be processed and its response to be sent. This is the interval from the time when Application Gateway receives the first byte of an HTTP request to the time when the response send operation finishes. It's important to note that this usually includes the Application Gateway processing time, time that the request and response packets are traveling over the network and the time the backend server took to respond. |`ApplicationGatewayTotalTime` |MilliSeconds |Average, Maximum |`Listener`|PT1M |No|
|**Requests per minute per Healthy Host**<p><p>Average request count per minute per healthy backend host in a pool |`AvgRequestCountPerHealthyHost` |Count |Average |`BackendSettingsPool`|PT1M |No|
|**WAF Bot Protection Matches**<p><p>Matched Bot Rules |`AzwafBotProtection` |Count |Total |`Action`, `Category`, `Mode`, `CountryCode`, `PolicyName`, `PolicyScope`|PT1M |Yes|

|**Backend Connect Time**<p><p>Time spent establishing a connection with a backend server |`BackendConnectTime` |MilliSeconds |Average, Maximum |`Listener`, `BackendServer`, `BackendPool`, `BackendHttpSetting`|PT1M |No|
|**Backend First Byte Response Time**<p><p>Time interval between start of establishing a connection to backend server and receiving the first byte of the response header, approximating processing time of backend server |`BackendFirstByteResponseTime` |MilliSeconds |Average, Maximum |`Listener`, `BackendServer`, `BackendPool`, `BackendHttpSetting`|PT1M |No|
|**Backend Last Byte Response Time**<p><p>Time interval between start of establishing a connection to backend server and receiving the last byte of the response body |`BackendLastByteResponseTime` |MilliSeconds |Average, Maximum |`Listener`, `BackendServer`, `BackendPool`, `BackendHttpSetting`|PT1M |No|
|**Backend Response Status**<p><p>The number of HTTP response codes generated by the backend members. This does not include any response codes generated by the Application Gateway. |`BackendResponseStatus` |Count |Total |`BackendServer`, `BackendPool`, `BackendHttpSetting`, `HttpStatusGroup`|PT1M |Yes|

|**Current Compute Units**<p><p>Compute Units consumed |`ComputeUnits` |Count |Average |\<none\>|PT1M |No|
|**CPU Utilization**<p><p>Current CPU utilization of the Application Gateway |`CpuUtilization` |Percent |Average |\<none\>|PT1M |No|
