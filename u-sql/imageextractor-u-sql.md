# ImageExtractor (U-SQL)
The `ImageExtractor` function from the `ImageCommon` assembly is used to extract data from images that will be consumed by other cognitive functions.  The current maximum size of a row is 4 MB so you will need to use images less than 4 MB in size when using `ImageExtractor`.


## Examples
- The example(s) can be executed in Visual Studio with the [Azure Data Lake Tools plug-in](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49504).  
- Ensure you have installed the cognitive assemblies, see [Registering Cognitive Extensions in U-SQL](cognitive-capabilities-in-u-sql.md#registeringExtensions) for more information.
- The scripts can be executed [locally](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-lake-analytics/data-lake-analytics-data-lake-tools-local-run) if you first download the assemblies locally, see [Enabling U-SQL Advanced Analytics for Local Execution](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/azuredatalake/2017/02/20/enabling-u-sql-advanced-analytics-for-local-execution/) for more information.
An Azure subscription and Azure Data Lake Analytics account is not needed when executed locally.
- You will need images accessible to you ADLA or Local account.

**Load images to a rowset variable**  
```sql
REFERENCE ASSEMBLY ImageCommon;   

@images =
    EXTRACT FileName string, 
            ImgData byte[]
    FROM @"/Samples/Images/{FileName}.jpg"
    USING new Cognition.Vision.ImageExtractor();

@result = 
    SELECT FileName FROM @images;

OUTPUT @result 
TO "/ReferenceGuide/Cognition/Vision/ImageExtractor_rv.txt" 
USING Outputters.Tsv();
```
<br />

**Load images to a table**<a name="loadImages"></a>  
This table will be referenced in various cognitive examples
```sql
REFERENCE ASSEMBLY ImageCommon;   

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS dbo.myImages;
CREATE TABLE dbo.myImages (
       INDEX clx_FileName CLUSTERED(FileName ASC) 
       DISTRIBUTED BY HASH (FileName)
) AS EXTRACT FileName   string,
            ImgData     byte[]
    FROM @"/Samples/Images/{FileName}.jpg"
    USING new Cognition.Vision.ImageExtractor();
```
