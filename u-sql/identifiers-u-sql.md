# Identifiers (U-SQL)
There are two types of identifiers in U-SQL: 
* [C# Identifiers](csharp-identifiers.md) that follow the C# naming conventions, and
* [U-SQL Identifiers](u-sql-identifiers.md) that are used to identify objects such as tables or databases or part of objects such as columns or indexes of tables. 
  
Both types of identifiers are always case-sensitive in U-SQL. This means for example that a table name `T` is going to be different from a table name `t` and a C# function `F` is different from a function `f`.
