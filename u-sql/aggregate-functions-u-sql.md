# Aggregate Functions (U-SQL)
U-SQL provides both built-in aggregation functions and the ability for the user to define [user-defined aggregators](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-lake-analytics/data-lake-analytics-u-sql-programmability-guide#use-user-defined-aggregates-udagg).  

An aggregator will compute a single result value over a group of values and will have an identity value for the case that the group is empty. 

In U-SQL, aggregators can only be used in the following syntactic contexts: 

* Inside a SELECT’s SELECT clause:
  * It will calculate the aggregated value for each group specified by a [GROUP BY](group-by-and-having-clauses-u-sql.md) clause. If the rowset is empty and thus all groups are empty, the [SELECT](select-expression-u-sql.md) expression will return an empty rowset. 

  * If no [GROUP BY](group-by-and-having-clauses-u-sql.md) has been specified, then every column in the [SELECT](select-clause-u-sql.md) clause has to be an expression that needs to contain at least one aggregator. The aggregations will be computed across the whole rowset of the `SELECT` expression. If the rowset is empty, then the aggregators return their identity value, which is the value that is would not change the aggregation result if it was added. I.e., 0 for [COUNT()](count-u-sql.md) and null for all others.

  * As part of a [U-SQL windowing expression](over-expression-u-sql.md) where it will calculate the aggregated value inside each window partition. Some built-in aggregators are not supported in [windowing expressions](over-expression-u-sql.md) (see each aggregator section for more details). 

  * Aggregations can appear in expressions 

  * Aggregations always need to be aliased in the [SELECT](select-clause-u-sql.md) clause. 
  
* Inside a [GROUP BY’s HAVING](group-by-and-having-clauses-u-sql.md) clause to provide a filter condition on the group based on the aggregation’s value. 
 
Some of the aggregators are type-polymorphic, meaning that they can operate on many different input types and return potentially different types based on their input type. For example, [COUNT ()](count-u-sql.md) will take any input type, and always return a value of type [long](numeric-types-and-literals.md), while [SUM ()](sum-u-sql.md) will return a value of a type that is dependent on the input type: [SUM](sum-u-sql.md)(v) where `v` is of type [double](numeric-types-and-literals.md) will return a result of type [double](numeric-types-and-literals.md); if `v` is an integral numeric type such as [int](numeric-types-and-literals.md), the result will be of type [long](numeric-types-and-literals.md). 

Several aggregators can be used in the same `SELECT` clause and will be applied on the groups. 

Aggregators cannot be nested. 

## Syntax
<pre>
Aggregate_Expression := 
    <a href="#aggr">Aggregator</a> '(' ['<a href="#dist">DISTINCT</a>'] <a href="#exp">expression</a> ')'. 
</pre>

## Semantics of Syntax Elements  

* <a name="aggr"></a>**`Aggregator`**  
Can be either the invocation of a user-defined aggregator or a built-in aggregator: 

  ### Syntax
  <pre>
  Aggregator :=
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-lake-analytics/data-lake-analytics-u-sql-programmability-guide#use-user-defined-aggregates-udagg">User_Defined_Aggregator</a> | <a href="#bltin_aggr">Built_In_Aggregator</a>.
  </pre>

  * <a name="bltin_aggr"></a>**`Built_In_Aggregator`**  
    U-SQL provides the following built-in aggregation functions (follow the links for more information): 

    ### Syntax
    <pre>
    Built_In_Aggregator :=
        <a href="any-value-u-sql.md">'ANY_VALUE'</a>
    |   <a href="array-agg-u-sql.md">'ARRAY_AGG'</a>
    |   <a href="avg-u-sql.md">'AVG'</a>
    |   <a href="count-u-sql.md">'COUNT'</a>
    |   <a href="map-agg-u-sql.md">'MAP_AGG'</a>
    |   <a href="max-u-sql.md">'MAX'</a>
    |   <a href="min-u-sql.md">'MIN'</a>
    |   <a href="sum-u-sql.md">'SUM'</a>
    |   <a href="stdev-u-sql.md">'STDEV'</a>
    |   <a href="stdevp-u-sql.md">'STDEVP'</a>
    |   <a href="var-u-sql.md">'VAR'</a>
    |   <a href="varp-u-sql.md">'VARP'</a>.
    </pre>

* <a name="dist"></a>**`DISTINCT`**  
Every aggregator can take an optional `DISTINCT` qualifier that will de-duplicate the values in the group before performing the aggregation. The data type of the values will have to be comparable if `DISTINCT` is being used. `DISTINCT` is not allowed when the aggregator is being used in an [OVER](over-expression-u-sql.md) expression.

* <a name="exp"></a>**`expression`**  
The C# expression (including column references) that gets aggregated. The expression cannot contain other aggregators. Some aggregators may support additional options besides
