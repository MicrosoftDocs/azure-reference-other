# U-SQL Concepts
U-SQL combines some familiar concepts from a variety of languages: It is a *declarative* language like SQL, it follows a *dataflow-like composition of statements and expressions* like Pig and Cascading*,* and provides simple ways to *extend the language* with [user-defined operators](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-lake-analytics/data-lake-analytics-u-sql-programmability-guide#user-defined-objects--udo), [user-defined aggregators](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-lake-analytics/data-lake-analytics-u-sql-programmability-guide#user-defined-aggregates--udagg) and [user-defined functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-lake-analytics/data-lake-analytics-u-sql-programmability-guide#user-defined-functions---udf) using C#, and provides a SQL database-like metadata object model to manage, discover and secure structured data and user-code.  

## How does a U-SQL Script process your Data
Currently, Azure Data Lake Analytics provides U-SQL for batch processing.  Therefore U-SQL is written and executed in form of a batch script. It follows the following general processing pattern:    
1.  Retrieve data from stored locations in rowset format    
    1.  Stored locations can be files that will be schematized on read with [EXTRACT](extract-expression-u-sql.md) expressions    
    2.  Stored locations can be U-SQL tables that are stored in a schematized format    
    3.  Or can be tables provided by other data sources such as an Azure SQL database.     
    
2.  Several transformations over the rowsets can be composed in a data flow format 
        
3.  Store the transformed rowset data    
    1.  Store it in a file with an [OUTPUT](output-statement-u-sql.md) statement, or    
    2.  Store it in a U-SQL table with an [INSERT](insert-u-sql.md) statement    

In addition, U-SQL also supports [data definition statements](data-definition-language-ddl-statements-u-sql.md) such as [CREATE TABLE](create-table-u-sql-creating-a-table-with-schema.md) to create metadata artifacts either in separate scripts or sometimes even in combination with the transformation scripts.  
  
U-SQL Scripts can be submitted in a variety of ways. In particular you can submit them directly from within the [Azure Data Lake Tools for Visual Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/data-lake-analytics-data-lake-tools-get-started/), from the [Azure Portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/data-lake-analytics-get-started-portal) or programmatically via the [Azure Data Lake SDK](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/data-lake-analytics-get-started-net-sdk/) job submission API or the [Azure Powershell](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/data-lake-analytics-get-started-powershell) extension's job submission command.
