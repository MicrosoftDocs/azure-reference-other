# Built-in U-SQL UDOs
U-SQL provides some common UDOs already built-in. Currently the built-in UDOs are providing [extraction from](u-sql-built-in-extractors.md) and [outputting to](u-sql-built-in-outputters.md) some common data formats. More UDOs may be added over time.  

|UDO  |Description|
|----|--|
|[Extractors](u-sql-built-in-extractors.md)|Used to generate a rowset from the input file or files.|
|[Outputters](u-sql-built-in-outputters.md) |Used to transform a rowset into a file or set of files.|
