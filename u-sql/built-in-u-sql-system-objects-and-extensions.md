# Built-in U-SQL System Objects and Extensions
U-SQL offers a set of built-in system objects and allows customers to install some extension libraries that provide additional capabilities to U-SQL.

## Built-in U-SQL System Objects

U-SQL provides a set of built-in catalog views that describe the content of the U-SQL Catalog for a specific Account and database. The catalog views are modelled after the SQL Server catalog views, but contain U-SQL specific information and live in the system-owned `usql` schema. 

See [Catalog Views (U-SQL)](catalog-views-u-sql.md) for a list of catalog views.

## U-SQL Extensions
The Azure Data Lake Analytics service offers the ability to install a set of extension libraries that enables customers to perform additional processing beyond the core U-SQL language.

The extensions are installed from the [Azure Data Lake Analytics Portal](http://portal.azure.com), and include the following capabilities:
-	[Scaling out Python scripts with U-SQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-lake-analytics/data-lake-analytics-u-sql-python-extensions)
-	[Scaling out R scripts with U-SQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-lake-analytics/data-lake-analytics-u-sql-r-extensions) 
-	[Cognitive Capabilities in U-SQL](cognitive-capabilities-in-u-sql.md)
