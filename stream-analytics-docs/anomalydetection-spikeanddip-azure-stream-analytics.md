# AnomalyDetection_SpikeAndDip

Detects temporary anomalies in a time series event. 

The underlying machine learning model uses the adaptive kernel density estimation algorithm.

## Syntax

```SQL
AnomalyDetection_SpikeAndDip(
    <scalar_expression>,
    <confidence>,
    <historySize>,
    <mode>)
OVER ([PARTITION BY <partition key>]
    LIMIT DURATION(<unit>, <length>)
    [WHEN boolean_expression])
```

## Arguments

**scalar_expression**

The event column or computed field over which the model performs anomaly detection. Allowed values for this parameter include FLOAT or BIGINT data types that return a single (scalar) value.

The wildcard expression * is not allowed. Also, *scalar_expression* cannot contain other analytic functions or external functions.

**confidence**

A percentage number from 1.00 to 100 (inclusive) that sets the sensitivity of the machine learning model. The lower the confidence, the higher the number of anomalies detected, and vice versa. Start from an arbitrary number between 70 and 90 and adjust this based on the results observed in development or testing.

**historySize**

The number of events in a sliding window that the model continuously learns from and uses for scoring the next event for anomalousness. Typically, this should represent the period of time of normal behavior to enable the model to flag a subsequent anomaly. Start with an educated guess using historical logs, and adjust based on the results observed in development or test.

**mode**

A string parameter whose value is "spikes", "dips", or "spikesanddips", to detect only spikes, only dips, or both spikes and dips, respectively.

**OVER ( [ partition_by_clause ] limit_duration_clause [when_clause])**

**partition_by_clause**

Used to partition a model's training based on a particular column in the events. The model applies the same function parameter settings across all the partitions.

**limit_duration_clause** DURATION(unit, length)

The size of the sliding window within Stream Analytics in terms of time. The recommended size of this time window is the equivalent of the time it takes to generate *historySize* number of events in steady state.

**when_clause**

Specifies boolean condition for the events to be accepted by the model to perform anomaly detection. The *when_clause* is optional.

## Return Types

The function returns a nested record composed of the following columns:

**IsAnomaly**

A BIGINT (0 or 1) indicating if the event was anomalous or not.

**Score**

The computed p-value score (float) indicating how anomalous an event is. Lower scores mean a lower probability that the event is part of the same distribution, and hence the more anomalous it is.

## Examples

The follwoing example assumes a uniform input rate of 1 event per second in a 2 minute sliding window with a history size of 120 events. The final SELECT statement extracts and outputs the score and anomaly status with a confidence level of 95%.

```SQL
WITH AnomalyDetectionStep AS
(
    SELECT
        EVENTENQUEUEDUTCTIME as time,
        CAST(temperature AS FLOAT) as temp,
        AnomalyDetection_SpikeAndDip(CAST(temperature AS FLOAT), 95, 120, 'spikesanddips')
        OVER(LIMIT DURATION(second, 120)) AS SpikeAndDipScores
    FROM input
)
SELECT
    time,
    temp,
    CAST(GetRecordPropertyValue(SpikeAndDipScores, 'Score') as FLOAT) AS
    SpikeAndDipScore,
    CAST(GetRecordPropertyValue(SpikeAndDipScores, 'IsAnomaly') AS BIGINT) AS
    IsSpikeAndDipAnomaly
INTO output
FROM AnomalyDetectionStep
```

Example with a non-uniform input stream that is made uniform using a tumbling window of 1 second:

```SQL
WITH SmootheningStep AS
(
    SELECT
        System.Timestamp() as time,
        AVG(CAST(temperature as float)) as temp
    FROM input
    GROUP BY TUMBLINGWINDOW(second, 1)
),
AnomalyDetectionStep AS
(
    SELECT
    time,
    temp,
    AnomalyDetection_SpikeAndDip(temp, 95, 120, 'spikesanddips') 
        OVER(LIMIT DURATION(second, 120)) as SpikeAndDipScores
    FROM SmootheningStep
)
SELECT
    time,
    temp,
    CAST(GetRecordPropertyValue(SpikeAndDipScores, 'Score') AS FLOAT) As
    SpikeAndDipScore,
    CAST(GetRecordPropertyValue(SpikeAndDipScores, 'IsAnomaly') AS BIGINT) AS
    IsSpikeAndDipAnomaly
INTO output
FROM AnomalyDetectionStep
```

Example with a partitioned query to train a separate model per sensor:

```SQL
WITH AnomalyDetectionStep AS
(
    SELECT
        sensorid,
        System.Timestamp() AS time,
        CAST(temperature AS FLOAT) AS temp,
        AnomalyDetection_SpikeAndDip(CAST(temperature AS FLOAT), 95, 120, 'spikesanddips')
            OVER(PARTITION BY sensorid LIMIT DURATION(second, 120)) AS SpikeAndDipScores
    FROM input
)
SELECT
    CAST (sensorid AS NVARCHAR(max)) AS sensoridstring,
    time,
    temp,
    CAST(GetRecordPropertyValue(SpikeAndDipScores, 'Score') as float) AS
    SpikeAndDipScore,
    CAST(GetRecordPropertyValue(SpikeAndDipScores, 'IsAnomaly') AS BIGINT) AS
    IsSpikeAndDipAnomaly
INTO output
FROM AnomalyDetectionStep
```
