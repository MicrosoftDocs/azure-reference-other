## Module Overview  

This article describes how to use the **Detect Languages** module in Machine Learning Studio (classic) to analyze text input and identify the language associated with each record in the input.

The language detection algorithm can identify many different languages. Just specify the string column to analyze, and the total number of languages to detect. The algorithm will analyze each row of text, and assign a probability score for each language. The language in the first result column is the language that got the highest score.

## How to configure Detect Languages

1. Add the dataset containing the text you want to analyze to an experiment in Machine Learning Studio (classic). The column with the text to analyze must be the string data type.

    The datset need not contain a label column; the language detection algorithm works purely on linguistic features of the supported languages.

    If you are importing new data, make sure that your data is saved in the UTF-8 format. Other Unicode formats are not supported.

2. Add the **Detect Languages** module to your experiment, and connect the dataset with the text for language detection.
  
3.  For **Text column**, choose the column you want to analyze.
  
4.  For **Upper bound on number of languages to detect**, indicate the maximum number of languages to detect.
  
     Setting an upper bound on the number of languages can improve performance.
  
5.  Run the experiment.
  
### Results

The **Detect Languages** module outputs a language identifier and score for each row.

For example, the following table contains a sample analysis on test data.
  
+ The first two columns *col1* and *language label* are columns passed through from the input dataset. In this example, because the input dataset was designed for testing the module, the expected language was already known, and is provided in the label column.
+ The remaining columns are generated by the **Detect Languages** module. If there are equi-probable language matches, several languages might be listed, with a score for each. In this case, the module predicts just one language for each row, together with the probability score for that language. 

    If the module fails to detect any language with a sufficiently high score, a result of (Unknown) with a score of 0 is output. However, the languages supported by the module can change over time as the API is updated.

## Examples

 For examples of how the **Detect Languages** module is used in an experiment, see the [Azure AI Gallery](https://gallery.azure.ai):
  
-  [Filter Movie Titles by Language](https://gallery.azure.ai/Experiment/Filter-Movie-Titles-by-Language-1): Detects the language used in movie names, and then uses the language identifier to split the dataset into English vs non-English movies.

## Technical notes

For a general idea of the languages that potentially can be detected, refer to [Bing Translator](https://www.bing.com/translator/).  

Many more languages can be detected than Machine Learning currently supports for advanced text analytics. We recommend that you use the results of **Detect Languages** to filter the results that you send to other modules that require language-specific processing.

The underlying linguistic services are also used by the [Text Analytics ](/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-language-detection) service in [Azure Cognitive Services](/azure/cognitive-services/).
