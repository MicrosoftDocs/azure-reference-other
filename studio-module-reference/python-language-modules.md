# Python Language Modules

This article describes the modules provided in Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic) that support running custom Python code in a machine learning experiment.

[!INCLUDE [studio-ui-applies-label](../includes/studio-ui-applies-label.md)]

The Python environment in Azure Machine Learning uses the Anaconda environment, which is easy to use and also includes some of the more important and popular Python packages, including `NumPy`, `SciPy`, and `scikit-learn`. To run Python code using these packages, just write your code in the text editor of the [Execute Python Script](execute-python-script.md) module. 


For more information about the Python envionment, see [Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Python Client Library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azureml/0.1.1).  

For more information about how you can use Python code in Azure Machine Learning, see these resources:

- [Execute Python Scripts in Azure Machine Learning](/azure/machine-learning/classic/execute-python-scripts)

- [Access datasets with Python using the Azure Machine Learning client library](/azure/machine-learning/machine-learning-python-data-access)

## List of modules

The Python Language Modules category includes the following module:
+ [Execute Python Script](execute-python-script.md): Executes a Python script from an Azure Machine Learning experiment
