# Python Language Modules

This article describes the modules provided in Azure Machine Learning Studio that support running custom Python code in a machine learning experiment.

The Python environment in Azure Machine Learning uses the Anaconda environment, which is easy to use and also includes some of the more important and popular Python packages, including `NumPy`, `SciPy`, and `scikit-learn`. To run Python code using these packages, just write your code in the text editor of the [Execute Python Script](execute-python-script.md) module. 


For more information about the Python envionment, see [Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Python Client Library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azureml/0.1.1).  

For more information about how you can use Python code in Azure Machine Learning, see these resources:

- [Execute Python Scripts in Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/machine-learning-execute-python-scripts)

- [Access datasets with Python using the Azure Machine Learning client library](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/machine-learning-python-data-access)
