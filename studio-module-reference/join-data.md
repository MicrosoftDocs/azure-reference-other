# Join Data
*Joins two datasets*  
  
 Category: [Data Transformation / Manipulation](data-transformation-manipulation.md)  
  
## Module overview  

This article describes how to use the [Join Data](join-data.md) module in Azure Machine Learning Studio to merge two datasets using a database-style *join operation*.  

To perform a join on two datasets, they must be related by a **single** key column. Composite keys are not supported. 

## How to configure Join Data

1. In Azure Machine Learning Studio, add the datasets you want to combine, and then drag the **Join Data** module into your experiment. 

    You can find the module in the **Data Transformation** category, under **Manipulation**.

2. Connect the datasets to the **Join Data** module. 
    
    The **Join Data** module does not support a right outer join, so if you want to ensure that rows from a particular dataset are included in the output, that dataset must be on the lefthand input.
  
3. Click **Launch column selector** to choose a single key column for the dataset on the left input.

4. Click **Launch column selector** to choose a single key column for the dataset on the right input.

5. Select the **Match case** option if you are joining on a text column and want to ensure that the join preserves case sensitivity. 

    For example, if you select this option, `A1000` would be considered a different key value than `a1000`.

    If you deselect this option, case sensitivity is **not** enforced, and `A1000` would be considered the same as `a1000`.
   
5. Use the **Join type** dropdown list to specify how the datasets should be combined. types:  
  
    - **Inner Join**: An *inner join* is the typical join operation. It returns the combined rows only when the values of the key columns match.  
  
    - **Left Outer Join**: A *left outer join* returns joined rows for all rows from the left table. When a row in the left table has no matching rows in the right table, the returned row contains missing values for all columns that come from the right table unless you specify a replacement value for missing values.  
  
    - **Full Outer Join**: A *full outer join* returns all rows from the left table (**table1**) and from the right table (**table2**).  
  
         For each of the rows in the left table that have no matching rows in the right table, the join results include a row containing missing values from the right table.  
  
         For each of the rows in the right table that have no matching rows in the left table, the join results include a row containing missing values for all columns from the left table.  
  
    - **Left Semi-Join**: A *left semi-join* returns only the values from the left table when the values of the key columns match.  

6. For the option, **Keep right key colums in joined table**:

    + Deselect the option to get a single key column in the results.
    + Leave the option selected to view the keys from both input tables. 

7. Run the experiment, or select the Join Data module and selected **Run Selected**, to perform the join.

8. To view the results, right-click the **Join Data** module, select **Results dataset**, and click **Visualize**.

## Examples  

You can see examples of how this module is used in the [Azure AI Gallery](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/):  
  
- [Breast cancer detection](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=525726): [Join Data](join-data.md) is used to combine the positive training cases with the negative training cases after the proportion of cases has been adjusted.  
  
- [Flight delay prediction](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=525725): In this sample, [Join Data](join-data.md) is used to bring together useful features from external datasets.  
  
- [Movie recommendation](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=525276): Two datasets are joined so that we can present the recommended movie titles rather than a movie ID.  
  
- [Prediction of student performance](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=525727): In this sample, [Join Data](join-data.md) is used to bring in new features.  

##  Technical notes  

This section describes implementation details, and answers to some frequently asked questions.

### Restrictions

+ The combined dataset cannot have two columns with the same name. If the left and right datasets have any duplicate column names, a numeric suffix is appended to the column names of the right dataset to make them unique. 

    For example, if both datasets had a column named Month, the column from the left dataset would remain as is, and the column from the right dataset would be renamed Month (1).  
  
+ The algorithm that is used for comparison of key values is hash-forced.  
  
+ Each column of the joined dataset preserves a categorical type, if the corresponding column of the input dataset is categorical.  
  
+ In left outer joins, if there are any missing values, a categorical level is created in the left dataset for missing values. This is true even if there are no missing values in the joined (right) dataset.  

### How can I join a table on a composite key?

If you need to join a table that uses composite keys (that is, the primary key relies on two independent columns), use a module such as the following to concatenate the contents of the two key columns:

+ [Execute R Script](execute-r-script.md)

    For example, use code like the follwing inside the R script to concatenate the first and second columns of the input dataframe using a hyphen as separator. 
    `paste(inputdf$Col1,inputdf$Col2,sep="-")`

+ [Apply SQL Transformation](apply-sql-transformation.md)

    The concatenation operator in SQLite is `||`.

### How can I join tables that don't have a key?

If your dataset has no key column, you can still combine it with another dataset, either by generating a key, or by using the [Add Columns](add-columns.md) module. 

The **Add Columns** module behaves like R, and can merge two datasets on a row-by-row basis, if the datasets have the same number of rows. An error is raised if the datasets are of a different size.
