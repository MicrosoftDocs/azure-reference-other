# Error 0003  
 Exception occurs if one or more of inputs are null or empty.  
  
 You will receive this error in Azure Machine Learning if any inputs or parameters to a module are null or empty.  This might occur, for example, when you did not type in any value for a parameter. It can also happen if you chose a dataset that has missing values, or an empty dataset.  
  
## Resolution  
 
+ Open the module that produced the exception and verify that all inputs have been specified. Ensure that all required inputs are specified. 
+ Make sure that data that is loaded from Azure storage is accessible, and that the account name or key has not changed.  
+ Check the input data for missing values, or nulls.
+ If using a query on a data source, verify that data is being returned in the format you expect. 
+ Check for typos or other changes in the specification of data.
