# Error 0133  
 The specified file was not found in the zip file  
  
 This error is produced when the filename entered in the **Dataset to Unpack** field of the **Property** pane does not match the name of any file found in the .zip file. The most common causes of this error are a typing error or searching the wrong archive file for the file to expand.  
  
## Resolution  
 Revisit the module. If the name of the file you intended to decompress appears in the list of files found, copy the file name and paste it into the **Dataset to Unpack** property box. If you do not see the desired file name in the list, verify that you have the correct .zip file and the correct name for the desired file.
