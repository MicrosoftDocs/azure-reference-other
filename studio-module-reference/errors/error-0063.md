# Error 0063  
 This exception is raised when R script evaluation fails with an error.  
  
 This error occurs when you have provided an R script in one of the [R language modules](../r-language-modules.md) in Azure Machine Learning, and the R code contains internal syntax errors. The exception can also occur if you provide the wrong inputs to the R script. 
 
 The error can also occur if the script is too big to execute in the workspace. The maximum script size for the **Execute R Script** module is 1,000 lines or 32KB of work space, whichever is lesser.
  
## Resolution  

1. In Azure Machine Learning Studio, right-click the module that has the error, and select **View Log**.
2. Examine the standard error log of the module, which contains the stack trace.
    + Lines beginning with [ModuleOutput] indicate output from R.
    + Messages from R marked as **warnings** typically do not cause the experiment to fail.
3. Resolve script issues.  
    + Check for R syntax errors. Check for variables that are defined but never populated.
    + Review the input data and the script to determine if either the data or variables in the script use characters not supported by Azure Machine Learning.
    + Check whether all package dependencies are installed.
    + Check whether your code loads required libraries that are not loaded by default.
    + Check whether the required packages are the correct version.
    + Make sure that any dataset that you want to output is converted to a data frame.  
4.  Resubmit the experiment.
