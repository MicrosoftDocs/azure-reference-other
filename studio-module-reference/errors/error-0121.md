# Error 0121  
 Thrown when SQL write fails because the table is unwriteable  
  
 This error in Azure Machine Learning is produced when you are using the [Export Data](../export-data.md) module to save results to a table in a SQL database, and the table cannot be written to. Typically, you will see this error if the [Export Data](../export-data.md) module successfully establishes a connection with the SQL Server instance, but is then unable to write the contents of the Azure ML dataset to the table.  
  
## Resolution  
 - Open the Properties pane of the [Export Data](../export-data.md) module and verify that the database and table names are entered correctly. 
 - Review the schema of the dataset you are exporting, and make sure that the data is compatile with the destination table.
 - Verify that the SQL login associated with the user name and password has permissions to write to the table. 
 - If the exception contains additional error information from SQL Server, use that information to make corrections.  
  
|Exception Messages|
