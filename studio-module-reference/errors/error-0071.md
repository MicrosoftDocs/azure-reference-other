# Error 0071  
 Exception occurs if provided credentials are incorrect.  
  
 This error in Azure Machine Learning occurs if the provided credentials are incorrect.  
  
 You might also receive this error if the module cannot connect to an HDInsight cluster.  
  
## Resolution  
 Review the inputs to the module and verify the account name and password.  
  
 Check for the following issues that can cause an error:  
  
-   The schema of the dataset does not match the schema of the destination datatable.  
  
-   Column names are missing or misstyped.  
  
-   You are writing to a table that has column names with illegal characters. Ordinarily you can enclose such column names in square brackets , but if that does not work, edit column names to use only letters and underscores (_)  
  
-   Strings that you are trying to write contain single quotation marks  
  
 If you are trying to connect to an HDInsight cluster, verify that the target cluster is accessible with the supplied credentials.
