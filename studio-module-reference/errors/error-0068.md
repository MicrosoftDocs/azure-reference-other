# Error 0068  
 Exception occurs if the specified Hive script is not correct.  
  
 This error in Azure Machine Learning occurs if there are syntax errors in a Hive QL script, or if the Hive interpreter encounters an error while executing the query or script.  
  
## Resolution  

The error message from Hive is normally reported back in the Error Log so that you can take action based on the specific error. 

+ Open the module and inspect the query for mistakes.  
+ Verify that the query works correctly outside of Azure Machine Learning by logging in to the Hive console of your Hadoop cluster and running the query.  
+ Try placing comments in your Hive script in a separate line as opposed to mixing executable statements and comments in a single line.  

### Resources
