# Error 0135  
 Only centroid-based cluster is supported.  
  
## Resolution  
 You might encounter this error message if you have attempted to evaluate a clustering model that is based on a custom clustering algorithm that does not use centroids to initialize the cluster.  
  
 You can use [Evaluate Model](../evaluate-model.md) to evaluate clustering models that are based on the  [K-Means Clustering](../k-means-clustering.md) module. For custom algorithms, use the [Execute R Script](../execute-r-script.md) module to create a custom evaluation script.
