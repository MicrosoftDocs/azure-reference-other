# Error 0102  
 Thrown when a ZIP file cannot be extracted.  
  
 This error in Azure Machine Learning occurs when you are importing a zipped package with the .zip extension, but the package is either not a zip file, or the file does not use a supported zip format.  
  
## Resolution  
 Make sure the selected file is a valid .zip file, and that it was compressed by using one of the supported compression algorithms.  
  
 If you get this error when importing datasets in compressed format, verify that all contained files use one of the supported file formats, and are in Unicode format. For more information, see [Unpack Zipped Datasets](../unpack-zipped-datasets.md).  
  
 Try re-adding the desired files to a new compressed zipped folder and try to add the custom module again.
