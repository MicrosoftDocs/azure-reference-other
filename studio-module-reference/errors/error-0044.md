# Error 0044  
 Exception occurs when it is not possible to derive element type of column from the existing values.  
  
 This error in Azure Machine Learning occurs when it is not possible to infer the type of a column or columns in a dataset. This typically happens when concatenating two or more datasets with different element types. If Azure Machine Learning is unable to determine a common type that is able to represent all the values in a column or columns without loss of information, it will generate this error.  
  
## Resolution  
 Ensure that all values in a given column in both datasets being combined are either of the same type (numeric, Boolean, categorical, string, date, etc.) or can be coerced to the same type.  
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|Cannot derive element type of the column.|  
|Cannot derive element type for column "{0}" -- all the elements are null references.|  
|Cannot derive element type for column "{0}" of dataset "{1}" -- all the elements are null references.|
