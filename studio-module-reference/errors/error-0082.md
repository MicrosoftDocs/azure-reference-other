# Error 0082  
 Exception occurs when a model cannot be successfully deserialized.  
  
 This error in Azure Machine Learning occurs when a saved machine learning model or transform cannot be loaded by a newer version of the Azure Machine Learning runtime as a result of a breaking change.  
  
## Resolution  
 The training experiment that produced the model or transform must be rerun and the model or transform must be resaved.  
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|Model could not be deserialized because it is likely serialized with an older serialization format. Please retrain and re-save the model.|
