# Error 0062  
 Exception occurs when attempting to compare two models with different learner types.  
  
 This error in Azure Machine Learning is produced when evaluation metrics for two different scored datasets cannot be compared. In this case, it is not possible to compare the effectiveness of the models used to produce the two scored datasets.  
  
## Resolution  
 Verify that the scored results are produced by the same kind of machine learning model (binary classification, regression, multi-class classification, recommendation, clustering, anomaly detection, etc.) All models that you compare must have the same learner type.
