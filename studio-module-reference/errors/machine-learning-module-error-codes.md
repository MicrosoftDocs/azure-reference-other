# Troubleshoot module exceptions in Azure Machine Learning using error codes

Learn about the error messages and exception codes you might encounter using  modules in Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic). 

To resolve the issue, look for the error in this article to read about common causes. There are two ways to get the full text of an error message in Studio (classic):  
 
- Click the link, **View Output Log**, in the right pane and scroll to the bottom. The detailed error message is displayed in the last two lines of the window.  
  
- Select the module that has the error, and click the red X. Only the pertinent error text is displayed.  
  
If the error message text is not helpful, send us information about the context and any desired additions or changes. You can either submit feedback on the error topic, or visit the [Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic) forum](https://aka.ms/aml-forum-studio) and post a question.  


## Error 0001  
 Exception occurs if one or more specified columns of data set couldn't be found.  
  
 You will receive this error if a column selection is made for a module, but the selected column(s) do not exist in the input data set. This error may occur if you have manually typed in a column name or if the column selector has provided a suggested column that did not exist in your dataset when you ran the experiment.  
  
**Resolution:**
 Revisit the module throwing this exception and validate that the column name or names are correct and that all referenced columns do exist.  
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|One or more specified columns were not found|  
|Column with name or index "{0}" not found|  
|Column with name or index "{0}" does not exist in "{1}"|  
 

## Error 0002  
 Exception occurs if one or more parameters could not be parsed or converted from specified type into required by target method type.  
  
 This error occurs in Azure Machine Learning when you specify a parameter as input and the value type is different from the type that is expected, and implicit conversion cannot be performed.  
  
**Resolution:**
 Check the module requirements and determine which value type is required (string, integer, double, etc.)  
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|Failed to parse parameter|  
|Failed to parse "{0}" parameter|  
|Failed to parse (convert) "{0}" parameter to "{1}"|  
|Failed to convert "{0}" parameter from "{1}" to "{2}"|  
|Failed to convert "{0}" parameter value "{1}" from "{2}" to "{3}"|  
|Failed to convert value "{0}" in column "{1}" from "{2}" to "{3}" with usage of the format "{4}" provided|  
  

## Error 0003  
 Exception occurs if one or more of inputs are null or empty.  
  
 You will receive this error in Azure Machine Learning if any inputs or parameters to a module are null or empty.  This error might occur, for example, when you did not type in any value for a parameter. It can also happen if you chose a dataset that has missing values, or an empty dataset.  
  
**Resolution:**
 
+ Open the module that produced the exception and verify that all inputs have been specified. Ensure that all required inputs are specified. 
+ Make sure that data that is loaded from Azure storage is accessible, and that the account name or key has not changed.  
+ Check the input data for missing values, or nulls.
+ If using a query on a data source, verify that data is being returned in the format you expect. 
+ Check for typos or other changes in the specification of data.
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|One or more of inputs are null or empty|  
|Input "{0}" is null or empty|  
  

## Error 0004  
 Exception occurs if parameter is less than or equal to specific value.  
  
 You will receive this error in Azure Machine Learning if the parameter in the message is below a boundary value required for the module to process the data.  
  
**Resolution:**
 Revisit the module throwing the exception and modify the parameter to be greater than the specified value.  
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|Parameter should be greater than boundary value.|  
|Parameter "{0}" value should be greater than {1}.|  
|Parameter "{0}" has value "{1}" which should be greater than {2}|  
  


## Error 0005  
 Exception occurs if parameter is less than a specific value.  
  
 You will receive this error in Azure Machine Learning if the parameter in the message is below or equal to a boundary value required for the module to process the data.  
  
**Resolution:**
 Revisit the module throwing the exception and modify the parameter to be greater than or equal to the specified value.  
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|Parameter should be greater than or equal to boundary value.|  
|Parameter "{0}" value should be greater than or equal to {1}.|  
|Parameter "{0}" has value "{1}" which should be greater than or equal to {2}.|  
  

## Error 0006  
 Exception occurs if parameter is greater than or equal to the specified value.  
  
 You will receive this error in Azure Machine Learning if the parameter in the message is greater than or equal to a boundary value required for the module to process the data.  
  
**Resolution:**
 Revisit the module throwing the exception and modify the parameter to be less than the specified value.  
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|Parameters mismatch. One of the parameters should be less than another.|  
|Parameter "{0}" value should be less than parameter "{1}" value.|  
|Parameter "{0}" has value "{1}" which should be less than {2}.|  
  

## Error 0007  
 Exception occurs if parameter is greater than a specific value.  
  
 You will receive this error in Azure Machine Learning if, in the properties for the module, you specified a value that is greater than is allowed. For example, you might specify a data that is outside the range of supported dates, or you might indicate that five columns be used when only three columns are available. 
 
 You might also see this error if you are specifying two sets of data that need to match in some way. For example, if you are renaming columns, and specify the columns by index, the number of names you supply must match the number of column indices. Another example might be a math operation that uses two columns, where the columns must have the same number of rows. 
  
**Resolution:**
 
 + Open the module in question and review any numeric property settings.
 + Ensure that any parameter values fall within the supported range of values for that property.
 + If the module takes multiple inputs, ensure that inputs are of the same size.
 + If the module has multiple properties that can be set, ensure that related properties have appropriate values. For example, when using [Group Data into Bins](../group-data-into-bins.md), if you use the option to specify custom bin edges, the number of bins must match the number of values you provide as bin boundaries.
 + Check whether the dataset or data source has changed. Sometimes a value that worked with a previous version of the data will fail after the number of columns, the column data types, or the size of the data has changed.  
  
|Exception messages|  
|------------------------|  
|Parameters mismatch. One of the parameters should be less than or equal to another.|  
|Parameter "{0}" value should be less than or equal to parameter "{1}" value.|  
|Parameter "{0}" has value "{1}" which should be less than or equal to {2}.|  
  

## Error 0008  
 Exception occurs if parameter is not in range.  
  
 You will receive this error in Azure Machine Learning if the parameter in the message is outside the bounds required for the module to process the data.  
  
 For example, this error is displayed if you try to use [Add Rows](../add-rows.md) to combine two datasets that have a different number of columns.  
  
**Resolution:**
 Revisit the module throwing the exception and modify the parameter to be within the specified range.  
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|Parameter value is not in the specified range.|  
|Parameter "{0}" value is not in range.|  
|Parameter "{0}" value should be in the range of [{1}, {2}].|  
  

## Error 0009  
 Exception occurs when the Azure storage account name or container name is specified incorrectly.  
  
This error occurs in Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic) when you specify parameters for an Azure storage account, but the name or password cannot be resolved. Errors on passwords or account names can happen for many reasons:
 
 + The account is the wrong type. Some new account types are not supported for use with Machine Learning Studio (classic). See [Import Data](../import-data.md) for details.
 + You entered the incorrect account name
 + The account no longer exists
 + The password for the storage account is wrong or has changed
 + You didn't specify the container name, or the container does not exist
 + You didn't fully specify the file path (path to the blob)
   
**Resolution:**

Such problems often occur when you try to manually enter the account name, password, or container path. We recommend that you use the new wizard for the [Import Data](../import-data.md) module, which helps you look up and check names.

Also check whether the account, container, or blob has been deleted. Use another Azure storage utility to verify that the account name and password have been entered correctly, and that the container exists. 

Some newer account types are not supported by Azure Machine Learning. For example, the new "hot" or "cold" storage types cannot be used for machine learning. Both classic storage accounts and storage accounts created as "General purpose" work fine.

If the complete path to a blob was specified, verify that the path is specified as **container/blobname**, and that both the container and the blob exist in the account.  
  
 The path should not contain a leading slash. For example **/container/blob** is incorrect and should be entered as **container/blob**.  

### Resources

See this article for an explanation of the different storage options that are supported: [Import data into Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic) from various online data sources with the Import Data module](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/machine-learning-import-data-from-online-sources)

### Sample experiments

See these experiments in the [Cortana Intelligence Gallery](https://gallery.azure.ai/) for examples of how to connect to different data sources:

+ Input data from various sources:  This lab provides a visual guide to using many of the Azure ML data sources: [AzureML experiments and data interaction](https://gallery.azure.ai/Tutorial/3-AzureML-Experiments-and-Data-Interaction-1)

+ Azure Cosmos DB: [Reading data from Azure Cosmos DB in Azure Machine Learning](https://gallery.azure.ai/Experiment/Reading-data-from-Azure-DocumentDB-in-Azure-Machine-Learning-1)

+ Import otherwise unreadable data using Python: [Load non-text file from Azure Blob storage](https://gallery.azure.ai/Experiment/Load-non-text-file-from-Azure-Blob-Storage-1)

  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|The Azure storage account name or container name is incorrect.|  
|The Azure storage account name "{0}" or container name "{1}" is incorrect; a container name of the format container/blob was expected.|  
  

## Error 0010  
 Exception occurs if input datasets have column names that should match but do not.  
  
 You will receive this error in Azure Machine Learning if the column index in the message has different column names in the two input datasets.  
  
**Resolution:**
 Use [Edit Metadata](../edit-metadata.md) or modify the original dataset to have the same column name for the specified column index.  
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|Columns with corresponding index in input datasets have different names.|  
|Column names are not the same for column {0} (zero-based) of input datasets ({1} and {2} respectively).|  
  

## Error 0011  
 Exception occurs if passed column set argument does not apply to any of dataset columns.  
  
 You will receive this error in Azure Machine Learning if the specified column selection does not match any of the columns in the given dataset.  
  
 You can also get this error if you haven't selected a column and at least one column is required for the module to work.  
  
**Resolution:**
 Modify the column selection in the module so that it will apply to the columns in the dataset.  
  
 If the module requires that you select a specific column, such as a label column, verify that the right column is selected.  
  
 If inappropriate columns are selected, remove them and rerun the experiment.  
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|Specified column set does not apply to any of dataset columns.|  
|Specified column set "{0}" does not apply to any of dataset columns.|  
  

## Error 0012  
 Exception occurs if instance of class could not be created with passed set of arguments.  
  
**Resolution:**
 This error is not actionable by the user and will be deprecated in a future release.  
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|Untrained model, train model first.|  
|Untrained model ({0}), use trained model.|  
  

## Error 0013  
 Exception occurs if the learner passed to the module is an invalid type.  
  
 This error occurs whenever a trained model is incompatible with the connected scoring module. For example, connecting the output of [Train Matchbox Recommender](../train-matchbox-recommender.md) to [Score Model](../score-model.md) (instead of [Score Matchbox Recommender](../score-matchbox-recommender.md)) will generate this error when the experiment is run.  
  
**Resolution:**

Determine the type of learner that is produced by the training module, and determine the scoring module that is appropriate for the learner. 

If the model was trained using any of the specialized training modules, connect the trained model only to the corresponding specialized scoring module.

|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|Learner of invalid type is passed.|  
|Learner "{0}" has invalid type.|  


## Error 0014  
 Exception occurs if the count of column unique values is greater than allowed.  
  
 This error occurs when a column contains too many unique values.  For example, you might see this error if you specify that a column be handled as categorical data, but there are too many unique values in the column to allow processing to complete. You might also see this error if there is a mismatch between the number of unique values in two inputs.   
  
**Resolution:**

Open the module that generated the error, and identify the columns used as inputs. For some modules, you can right-click the dataset input and select **Visualize** to get statistics on individual columns, including the number of unique values and their distribution.

For columns that you intend to use for grouping or categorization, take steps to reduce the number of unique values in columns. You can reduce in different ways, depending on the data type of the column. 

+ For text data, you might be able to use [Preprocess Text](../preprocess-text.md) to collapse similar entries. 
+ For numeric data, you can create a smaller number of bins using [Group Data into Bins](../group-data-into-bins.md), remove or truncate values using [Clip Values](../clip-values.md), or use machine learning methods such as [Principal Component Analysis](../principal-component-analysis.md) or [Learning with Counts](../data-transformation-learning-with-counts.md) to reduce the dimensionality of the data.  

> [!TIP]
> Unable to find a resolution that matches your scenario? You can provide feedback on this topic that includes the name of the module that generated the error, and the data type and cardinality of the column. We will use the information to provide more targeted troubleshooting steps for common scenarios.   
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|Number of column unique values is greater than allowed.|  
|Number of unique values in column: "{0}" exceeds tuple count of {1}.|  
  

## Error 0015  
 Exception occurs if database connection has failed.  
  
 You will receive this error if you enter an incorrect SQL account name, password, database server, or database name, or if a connection with the database cannot be established due to problems with the database or server.  
  
**Resolution:**
 Verify that the account name, password, database server, and database have been entered correctly, and that the specified account has the correct level of permissions. Verify that the database is currently accessible.  
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|Error making database connection.|  
|Error making database connection: {0}.|  
  


## Error 0016  
 Exception occurs if input datasets passed to the module should have compatible column types but do not.  
  
 You will receive this error in Azure Machine Learning if the types of the columns passed in two or more datasets are not compatible with each other.  
  
**Resolution:**
 Use [Edit Metadata](../edit-metadata.md), modify the original input dataset, or use [Convert to Dataset](../convert-to-dataset.md) to ensure that the types of the columns are compatible.  
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|Columns with corresponding index in input datasets do have incompatible types.|  
|Columns {0} and {1} are incompatible.|  
|Column element types are not compatible for column {0} (zero-based) of input datasets ({1} and {2} respectively).|  
  

## Error 0017  
 Exception occurs if a selected column uses a data type that is not supported by the current module.  
  
 For example, you might receive this error in Azure Machine Learning if your column selection includes a column with a data type that cannot be processed by the module, such as a string column for a math operation, or a score column where a categorical feature column is required.  
  
**Resolution:**
 1. Identify the column that is the problem.
 2. Review the requirements of the module.
 3. Modify the column to make it conform to requirements. You might need to use several of the following modules to make changes, depending on the column and the conversion you are attempting:
    + Use [Edit Metadata](../edit-metadata.md) to change the data type of columns, or to change the column usage from feature to numeric, categorical to non-categorical, and so forth.
    + Use [Convert to Dataset](../convert-to-dataset.md) to ensure that all included columns use data types that are supported by Azure Machine Learning.  If you cannot convert the columns, consider removing them from the input dataset.
    + Use the [Apply SQL Transformation](../apply-sql-transformation.md) or [Execute R Script](../execute-r-script.md) modules to cast or convert any columns that cannot be modified using [Edit Metadata](../edit-metadata.md). These modules provide more flexibility for working with datetime data types.
    + For numeric data types, you can use the [Apply Math Operation](../apply-math-operation.md) module to round or truncate values, or use the [Clip Values](../clip-values.md) module to remove out of range values.  
 4. As a last resort, you might need to modify the original input dataset.

You can provide feedback on this topic that includes the name of the module that generated the error, and the data type and cardinality of the column. We will use the information to provide more targeted troubleshooting steps for common scenarios. 
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|Cannot process column of current type. The type is not supported by the module.|  
|Cannot process column of type {0}. The type is not supported by the module.|  
|Cannot process column "{1}" of type {0}. The type is not supported by the module.|  
|Cannot process column "{1}" of type {0}. The type is not supported by the module. Parameter name: {2}|  
  

## Error 0018  
 Exception occurs if input dataset is not valid.  
  
**Resolution:**
 This error in Azure Machine Learning can appear in many contexts, so there is not a single resolution. In general, the error indicates that the data provided as input to a module has the wrong number of columns, or that the data type does not match requirements of the module. For example:  
  
-   The module requires a label column, but no column is marked as a label, or you have not selected a label column yet.  
  
-   The module requires that data be categorical but your data is numeric.  
  
-   The module requires a specific data type. For example, ratings provided to [Train Matchbox Recommender](../train-matchbox-recommender.md) can be either numeric or categorical, but cannot be floating point numbers.  
  
-   The data is in the wrong format.  
  
-   Imported data contains invalid characters, bad values, or out of range values.  
-   The column is empty or contains too many missing values.  
  
 To determine the requirements and how your data might, review the help topic for the module that will be consuming the dataset as input.  
  
 We also recommend that you use [Summarize Data](../summarize-data.md) or [Compute Elementary Statistics](../compute-elementary-statistics.md) to profile your data, and use these modules to fix metadata and clean values: [Edit Metadata](../edit-metadata.md), [Clean Missing Data](../clean-missing-data.md), [Clip Values](../clip-values.md).  
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|Dataset is not valid.|  
|{0} contains invalid data.|  
|{0} and {1} should be consistent column wise.|  
  

## Error 0019  
 Exception occurs if column is expected to contain sorted values, but it does not.  
  
 You will receive this error in Azure Machine Learning if the specified column values are out of order.  
  
**Resolution:**
 Sort the column values by manually modifying the input dataset and rerun the module.  
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|Values in column are not sorted.|  
|Values in column "{0}" are not sorted.|  
|Values in column "{0}" of dataset "{1}" are not sorted.|  
  

## Error 0020  
 Exception occurs if number of columns in some of the datasets passed to the module is too small.  
  
 You will receive this error in Azure Machine Learning if not enough columns have been selected for a module.  
  
**Resolution:**
 Revisit the module and ensure that column selector has correct number of columns selected.  
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|Number of columns in input dataset is less than allowed minimum.|  
|Number of columns in input dataset is less than allowed minimum of {0} column(s).|  
|Number of columns in input dataset "{0}" is less than allowed minimum of {1} column(s).|

## Error 0021  
 Exception occurs if number of rows in some of the datasets passed to the module is too small.  
  
 This error in seen in Azure Machine Learning when there are not enough rows in the dataset to perform the specified operation. For example, you might see this error if the input dataset is empty, or if you are trying to perform an operation that requires some minimum number of rows to be valid. Such operations can include (but are not limited to) grouping or classification based on statistical methods, certain types of binning, and learning with counts.  
  
**Resolution:**
 
 + Open the module that returned the error, and check the input dataset and module properties. 
 + Verify that the input dataset is not empty and that there are enough rows of data to meet the requirements described in module help.  
 + If your data is loaded from an external source, make sure that the data source is available and that there is no error or change in the data definition that would cause the import process to get fewer rows.
 + If you are performing an operation on the data upstream of the module that might affect the type of data or the number of values, such as cleaning, splitting, or join operations, check the outputs of those operations to determine the number of rows returned.  



## Error 0022  
 Exception occurs if number of selected columns in input dataset does not equal to the expected number.  
  
 This error in Azure Machine Learning can occur when the downstream module or operation requires a specific number of columns or inputs, and you have provided too few or too many columns or inputs. For example:  
  
-   You specify a single label column or key column and accidentally selected multiple columns.  
  
-   You are renaming columns, but provided more or fewer names than there are columns.  
  
-   The number of columns in the source or destination has changed or doesn't match the number of columns used by the module.  
  
-   You have provided a comma-separated list of values for inputs, but the number of values does not match, or multiple inputs are not supported.  
  
**Resolution:**
 Revisit the module and check the column selection to ensure that the correct number of columns is selected. Verify the outputs of upstream modules, and the requirements of downstream operations.  
  
 If you used one of the column selection options that can select multiple columns (column indices, all features, all numeric, etc.), validate the exact number of columns returned by the selection.  
  
 If you are trying to specify a comma-separated list of datasets as inputs to [Unpack Zipped Datasets](../unpack-zipped-datasets.md), unpack only one dataset at a time. Multiple inputs are not supported.  
  
 Verify that the number or type of upstream columns has not changed.  
  
 If you are using a recommendation dataset to train a model, remember that the recommender expects a limited number of columns, corresponding to user-item pairs or user-item-rankings. Remove additional columns before training the model or splitting recommendation datasets. For more information, see [Split Data](../split-data.md).  
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|Number of selected columns in input dataset does not equal to the expected number.|  
|Number of selected columns in input dataset does not equal to {0}.|  
|Column selection pattern "{0}" provides number of selected columns in input dataset not equal to {1}.|  
|Column selection pattern "{0}" is expected to provide {1} column(s) selected in input dataset, but {2} column(s) is/are provided.|  



## Error 0023  
 Exception occurs if target column of input dataset is not valid for the current trainer module.  
  
 This error in Azure Machine Learning  occurs if the target column (as selected in the module parameters) is not of the valid data-type, contained all missing values, or was not categorical as expected.  
  
**Resolution:**
 Revisit the module input to inspect the content of the label/target column. Make sure it does not have all missing values. If the module is expecting target column to be categorical, make sure that there are more than one distinct values in the target column.  
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|Input dataset has unsupported target column.|  
|Input dataset has unsupported target column "{0}".|  
|Input dataset has unsupported target column "{0}" for learner of type {1}.|  
 

## Error 0024  
Exception occurs if dataset does not contain a label column.  

 This error in Azure Machine Learning occurs when the module requires a label column and the dataset does not have a label column. For example, evaluation of a scored dataset usually requires that a label column is present to compute accuracy metrics.  
 
It can also happen that a label column is present in the dataset, but not detected correctly by Azure Machine Learning.
  
**Resolution:**

+ Open the module that generated the error, and determine if a label column is present. The name or data type of the column doesn't matter, as long as the column contains a single outcome (or dependent variable) that you are trying to predict. If you are not sure which column has the label, look for a generic name such as  *Class* or *Target*. 
+  If the dataset does not include a label column, it is possible that the label column was explicitly or accidentally removed upstream. It could also be that the dataset is not the output of an upstream scoring module.
+ To explicitly mark the column as the label column, add the [Edit Metadata](../edit-metadata.md) module and connect the dataset. Select only the label column, and select **Label** from the **Fields** dropdown list. 
+ If the wrong column is chosen as the label, you can select **Clear label** from the **Fields** to fix the metadata on the column. 
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|There is no label column in dataset.|  
|There is no label column in "{0}".|  
  

## Error 0025  
 Exception occurs if dataset does not contain a score column.  
  
 This error in Azure Machine Learning occurs if the input to the evaluate model does not contain valid score columns. For example, the user attempts to evaluate a dataset before it was scored with a correct trained model, or the score column was explicitly dropped upstream. This exception also occurs if the score columns on the two datasets are incompatible. For example, you might be trying to compare the accuracy of a linear regressor with that of a binary classifier.  
  
**Resolution:**
 Revisit the input to the evaluate model and examine if it contains one or more score columns. If not, the dataset was not scored or the score columns were dropped in an upstream module.  
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|There is no score column in dataset.|  
|There is no score column in "{0}".|  
|There is no score column in "{0}" that is produced by a "{1}". Score the dataset using the correct type of learner.|  
  

## Error 0026  
 Exception occurs if columns with the same name are not allowed.  
  
 This error in Azure Machine Learning occurs if multiple columns have the same name. One way you may receive this error is if the dataset does not have a header row and column names are automatically assigned: Col0, Col1, etc.  
  
**Resolution:**
 If columns have same name, insert a [Edit Metadata](../edit-metadata.md) module between the input dataset and the module. Use the column selector in [Edit Metadata](../edit-metadata.md) to select columns to rename, typing the new names into the **New column names** textbox.

## Error 0035  
 Exception occurs if no features were provided for a given user or item.  
  
 This error in Azure Machine Learning occurs you are trying to use a recommendation model for scoring but a feature vector cannot be found.  
  
**Resolution:**

The Matchbox recommender has certain requirements that must be met when using either item features or user features.  This error indicates that a feature vector is missing for a user or item that you provided as input.  You must ensure that a vector of features is available in the data for each user or item.  
  
 For example, if you trained a recommendation model using features such as the user's age, location, or income, but now want to create scores for new users who were not seen during training, you must provide some equivalent set of features (namely, age, location, and income values) for the new users in order to make appropriate predictions for them. 
 
 If you do not have any features for these users, consider feature engineering to generate appropriate features.  For example, if you do not have individual user age or income values, you might generate approximate values to use for a group of users. 
 
When you are scoring from a recommendation mode, you can use item or user features only if you previously used item or user features during training. For more information, see [Score Matchbox Recommender](../score-matchbox-recommender.md).
 
For general information about how the Matchbox recommendation algorithm works, and how to prepare a dataset of item features or user features, see [Train Matchbox Recommender](../train-matchbox-recommender.md).

## Error 0042  
 Exception occurs when it is not possible to convert column to another type.  
  
 This error in Azure Machine Learning occurs when it is not possible to convert column to the specified type.  You will receive this error if a module requires a particular data type, such as datetime, text, a floating point number, or integer, but it is not possible to convert an existing column to the required type.  
 
For example, you might select a column and try to convert it to a numeric data type for use in a math operation, and get this error if the column contained invalid data. 

Another reason you might get this error if you try to use a column containing floating point numbers or many unique values as a categorical column. 
  
**Resolution:**

+ Open the help page for the module that generated the error, and verify the data type requirements.
+ Review the data types of the columns in the input dataset.
+ Inspect data originating in so-called schema-less data sources.
+ Check the dataset for missing values or special characters that might block conversion to the desired data type. 
    + Numeric data types should be consistent: for example, check for floating point numbers in a column of integers.
    + Look for text strings or NA values in a number column. 
    + Boolean values can be converted to an appropriate representation depending on the required data type.
    + Examine text columns for non-unicode characters, tab characters, or control characters
    + Datetime data should be consistent to avoid modeling errors, but cleanup can be complex owing to the many formats. Consider using the [Execute R Script](../execute-r-script.md) or [Execute Python Script](../execute-python-script.md) modules to perform cleanup.  
+ If necessary, modify the values in the input dataset so that the column can be converted successfully. Modification might include binning, truncation or rounding operations, elimination of outliers, or imputation of missing values. See the following articles for some common data transformation scenarios in machine learning:
    + [Clip Values](../clip-values.md) 
    + [Clean Missing Data](../clean-missing-data.md)
    + [Normalize Data](../normalize-data.md)
    + [Group Data Into Bins](../group-data-into-bins.md)

 The error can also occur if the script is too large to execute in the workspace. The maximum script size for the **Execute R Script** module is 1,000 lines or 32 KB of work space, whichever is lesser.
  
**Resolution:**

1. In Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic), right-click the module that has the error, and select **View Log**.
2. Examine the standard error log of the module, which contains the stack trace.
    + Lines beginning with [ModuleOutput] indicate output from R.
    + Messages from R marked as **warnings** typically do not cause the experiment to fail.
3. Resolve script issues.  
    + Check for R syntax errors. Check for variables that are defined but never populated.
    + Review the input data and the script to determine if either the data or variables in the script use characters not supported by Azure Machine Learning.
    + Check whether all package dependencies are installed.
    + Check whether your code loads required libraries that are not loaded by default.
    + Check whether the required packages are the correct version.
    + Make sure that any dataset that you want to output is converted to a data frame.  
4.  Resubmit the experiment.

## Error 0077  
 Exception occurs when unknown blob file writes mode passed.  
  
 This error in Azure Machine Learning occurs if an invalid argument is passed in the specifications for a blob file destination or source.  
  
**Resolution:**
 In almost all modules that import or export data to and from Azure blob storage, parameter values controlling the write mode are assigned by using a dropdown list; therefore, it is not possible to pass an invalid value, and this error should not appear. This error will be deprecated in a later release.  
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|Unsupported blob writes mode.|  
|Unsupported blob writes mode: {0}.|

|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|The Azure storage container name is incorrect.|  
|The Azure storage container name "{0}" is incorrect; a container name of the format container/blob was expected.|  
  

## Error 0080  
 Exception occurs when column with all values missing is not allowed by module.  
  
 This error in Azure Machine Learning is produced when one or more of the columns consumed by the module contains all missing values. For example, if a module is computing aggregate statistics for each column, it cannot operate on a column containing no data. In such cases, module execution is halted with this exception.  
  
**Resolution:**
 Revisit the input dataset and remove any columns that contain all missing values.  
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|Columns with all values missing are not allowed.|  
|Column {0} has all values missing.|  
  

## Error 0081  
 Exception occurs in PCA module if number of dimensions to reduce to is equal to number of feature columns in input dataset, containing at least one sparse feature column.  
  
 This error in Azure Machine Learning is produced if the following conditions are met: (a) the input dataset has at least one sparse column and (b) the final number of dimensions requested is the same as the number of input dimensions.  
  
**Resolution:**
 Consider reducing the number of dimensions in the output to be fewer than the number of dimensions in the input. This is typical in applications of PCA.  For more information, see [Principal Component Analysis](../principal-component-analysis.md).  
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|For dataset containing sparse feature columns number of dimensions to reduce should be less than number of feature columns.|

**Resolution:**
 The training experiment that produced the model or transform must be rerun and the model or transform must be resaved.  
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|Model could not be deserialized because it is likely serialized with an older serialization format. Retrain and resave the model.|  
  

## Error 0083  
 Exception occurs if dataset used for training cannot be used for concrete type of learner.  
  
 This error in Azure Machine Learning is produced when the dataset is incompatible with the learner being trained. For example, the dataset might contain at least one missing value in each row, and as a result, the entire dataset would be skipped during training. In other cases, some machine learning algorithms such as anomaly detection do not expect labels to be present and can throw this exception if labels are present in the dataset.  
  
**Resolution:**
 Consult the documentation of the learner being used to check requirements for the input dataset. Examine the columns to see all required columns are present.  
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|Dataset used for training is invalid.|  
|{0} contains invalid data for training.|  
|{0} contains invalid data for training. Learner type: {1}.|

 This error in Azure Machine Learning occurs when you are creating a count table and the label column contains a different number of classes than you specified in the module parameters.  
  
**Resolution:**
 Check your dataset and find out exactly how many distinct values (possible classes) there are in the label column. When you create the count table, you must specify at least this number of classes.  
  
 The count table cannot automatically determine the number of classes available.  
  
 When you create the count table, you cannot specify 0 or any number that is less than the actual number of classes in the label column.  
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|The number of classes is incorrect. Make sure that the number of classes you specify in the parameter pane is greater than or equal to the number of classes in the label column.|  
|The number of classes specified is '{0}', which is not greater than a label value '{1}' in the data set used to count. Make sure that the number of classes you specify in the parameter pane is greater than or equal to the number of classes in the label column.|

## Error 0103  
 Thrown when a ZIP file does not contain any .xml files  
  
 This error in Azure Machine Learning occurs when the custom module zip package does not contain any module definition (.xml) files. These files need to reside in the root of the zip package (for example, not within a subfolder.)  
  
**Resolution:**
 Verify that one or more xml module definition files are in the root folder of the zip package by extracting it to a temporary folder on your disk drive. Any xml files should be directly in the folder you extracted the zip package to. Make sure when you create the zip package that you do not  select a folder that contains xml files to zip as this will create a sub folder within the zip package with the same name as the folder you selected to zip.  
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|Given ZIP file does not contain any module definition files (.xml files)|  


## Error 0104  
 Thrown when a module definition file references a script that cannot be located  
  
 This error in Azure Machine Learning is thrown when a custom module xml definition file references a script file in the **Language** element that does not exist in the zip package. The script file path is defined in the **sourceFile** property of the **Language** element. The path to the source file is relative to the root of the zip package (same location as the module xml definition files). If the script file is in a sub folder, the relative path to the script file must be specified. For instance, if all scripts were stored in a **myScripts** folder within the zip package, the **Language** element would have to add this path to the **sourceFile** property as below. For example:  
  
 `<Language name="R" sourceFile="myScripts/CustomAddRows.R" entryPoint="CustomAddRows" />`  
  
**Resolution:**
 Make sure that the value of the **sourceFile** property in the **Language** element of the custom module xml definition is correct and that the source file exists in the correct relative path in the zip package.

## Error 0134
Exception occurs when label column is missing or has insufficient number of labeled rows.  
  
This error occurs when the module requires a label column, but you did not include one in the column selection, or the label column is missing too many values.

This error can also occur when a previous operation changes the dataset such that insufficient rows are available to a downstream operation. For example, suppose you use an expression in the **Partition and Sample** module to divide a dataset by values. If no matches are found for your expression, one of the datasets resulting from the partition would be empty.

Resolution: 

 If you include a label column in the column selection but it isn’t recognized, use the [Edit Metadata](../edit-metadata.md) module to mark it as a label column.
  
 Use the [Summarize Data](../summarize-data.md) module to generate a report that shows how many values are missing in each column. Then, you can use the [Clean Missing Data](../clean-missing-data.md) module to remove rows with missing values in the label column. 

 Check your input datasets to make sure that they contain valid data, and enough rows to satisfy the requirements of the operation. Many algorithms will generate an error message if they require some minimum number rows of data, but the data contains only a few rows, or only a header.
  
|Exception Messages|
|------------------------|
|Exception occurs when label column is missing or has insufficient number of labeled rows.|  
|Exception occurs when label column is missing or has less than {0} labeled rows|

## Error 0138  
 Memory has been exhausted, unable to complete running of module. Downsampling the dataset may help to alleviate the problem.  
  
 This error occurs when the module that is running requires more memory than is available in the Azure container. This can happen if you are working with a large dataset and the current operation cannot fit into memory.  
  
**Resolution:**
 If you are trying to read a large dataset and the operation cannot be completed, downsampling the dataset might help.  
  
 If you use the visualizations on datasets to check the cardinality of columns, only some rows are sampled. To get a full report, use [Summarize Data](../summarize-data.md). You can also use the [Apply SQL Transformation](../apply-sql-transformation.md) to check for the number of unique values in each column.  
  
 Sometimes transient loads can lead to this error. Machine support also changes over time. See the [Azure Machine Learning FAQ](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/machine-learning/studio/faq/) for  a description of supported data size.  
  
 Try using [Principal Component Analysis](../principal-component-analysis.md) or one of the provided feature selection methods to reduce your dataset to a smaller set of more feature-rich columns: [Feature Selection](../feature-selection-modules.md)  
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|Memory has been exhausted, unable to complete running of module.|  
  

## Error 0139  
 Exception occurs when it is not possible to convert a column to another type.  
  
 This error in Azure Machine Learning occurs when you try to convert a column to a different data type, but that type is not supported by the current operation or by the module.  
  
 The error might also appear when a module tries to implicitly convert data to meet requirements of the current module, but the conversion is not possible.  
  
**Resolution:**

1. Review your input data and determine the exact data type of the column that you want to use, and the data type of the column that is producing the error. Sometimes you might think the data type is correct, but find that an upstream operation has modified the data type or usage of a column. Use the [Edit Metadata](../edit-metadata.md) module to reset column metadata to its original state. 
2. Look at the module help page to verify the requirements for the specified operation. Determine which data types are supported by the current module, and what range of values is supported. 
3. If values need to be truncated, rounded, or outliers removed, use the [Apply Math Operation](../apply-math-operation.md) or [Clip Values](../clip-values.md) modules to make corrections.
4. Consider whether it is possible to convert or cast the column to a different data type. The following modules all provide considerable flexibility and power for modifying data: 
  
   + [Apply SQL Transformation](../apply-sql-transformation.md)
   + [Execute R Script](../execute-r-script.md)
   + [Execute Python Script](../execute-python-script.md).  

> [!NOTE]
> Still not working? Consider providing additional feedback on the problem, to help us develop better troubleshooting guidance. Just submit feedback on this page and provide the name of the module that generated the error, and the data type conversion that failed.

## Error 0141  
 Exception occurs if the number of the selected numerical columns and unique values in the categorical and string columns is too small.  
  
 This error in Azure Machine Learning occurs when there are not enough unique values in the selected column to perform the operation.  
  
**Resolution:**
 Some operations perform statistical operations on feature and categorical columns, and if there are not enough values, the operation might fail or return an invalid result. Check your dataset to see how many values there are in the fature and label columns, and determine whether the operation you are trying to perform is statistically valid.  
  
 If the source dataset is valid, you might also check whether some upstream data manipulation or metadata operation has changed the data and removed some values.  
  
 If upstream operations include splitting, sampling, or resampling, verify that the outputs contain the expected number of rows and values.  
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|The number of the selected numerical columns and unique values in the categorical and string columns is too small.|
