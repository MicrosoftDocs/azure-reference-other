# Error 0057  
 Exception occurs when attempting to create a file or blob that already exists.  
  
 This exception occurs when you are using the [Export Data](../export-data.md) module or other module to save  results of an experiment in Azure Machine Learning to Azure blob storage, but you attempt to create a file or blob that already exists.   
  
## Resolution  
 
 You will receive this error only if you previously set the property **Azure blob storage write mode** to **Error**. By design, this module raises an error if you attempt to write a dataset to a blob that already exists.
 
 - Open the module properties and change the property **Azure blob storage write mode** to **Overwrite**.
 - Alternatively, you can type the name of a different destination blob or file and be sure to specify a blob that does not already exist.
