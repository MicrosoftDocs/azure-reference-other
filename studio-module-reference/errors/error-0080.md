# Error 0080  
 Exception occurs when column with all values missing is not allowed by module.  
  
 This error in Azure Machine Learning is produced when one or more of the columns consumed by the module contains all missing values. For example, if a module is computing aggregate statistics for each column, it cannot operate on a column containing no data. In such cases, module execution is halted with this exception.  
  
## Resolution  
 Revisit the input dataset and remove any columns that contain all missing values.
