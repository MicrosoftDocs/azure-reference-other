# Error 0083  
 Exception occurs if dataset used for training cannot be used for concrete type of learner.  
  
 This error in Azure Machine Learning is produced when the dataset is incompatible with the learner being trained. For example, the dataset might contain at least one missing value in each row, and as a result, the entire dataset would be skipped during training. In other cases, some machine learning algorithms such as anomaly detection do not expect labels to be present and can throw this exception if labels are present in the dataset.  
  
## Resolution  
 Consult the documentation of the learner being used to check requirements for the input dataset. Examine the columns to see all required columns are present.  
  
|Exception Messages|  
|------------------------|  
|Dataset used for training is invalid.|  
|{0} contains invalid data for training.|  
|{0} contains invalid data for training. Learner type: {1}.|
