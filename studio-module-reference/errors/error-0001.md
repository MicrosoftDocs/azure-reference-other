# Error 0001  
 Exception occurs if one or more specified columns of data set couldn't be found.  
  
 You will receive this error if a column selection is made for a module, but the selected column(s) do not exist in the input data set. This may occur if you have manually typed in a column name or if the column selector has provided a suggested column that did not exist in your dataset when you ran the experiment.  
  
## Resolution  
 Revisit the module throwing this exception and validate that the column name or names are correct and that all referenced columns do exist.

|------------------------|  
|One or more specified columns were not found|  
|Column with name or index "{0}" not found|
