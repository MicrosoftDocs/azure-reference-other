# ICluster interface

This article describes `ICluster`, which is the interface for trained clustering models that is used in Azure Machine Learning Studio.

The `ICluster` interface provides methods and properties that are used to configure and interact with clustering models. A learner is defined as a set of instructions that perform standardized machine learning tasks. 

The `ICluster` interface provides the following methods and properties for working with clustering models:

+ Gets or sets the feature attributes
+ Trains a clustering model from data
+ Applies a clustering model to new data

You can interact with `ICluster` only in Studio, or in one of the supported APIs.  

For classification or regression models, use the [iLearner](ilearner-interface.md) interface.
