# Evaluate Probability Function
*Fits a specified probability distribution function to a dataset*  
  
 Category: [Statistical Functions](statistical-functions.md)  

[!INCLUDE [studio-ui-applies-label](../includes/studio-ui-applies-label.md)]
  
## Module overview  

This article describes how to use the [Evaluate Probability Function](evaluate-probability-function.md) module in Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic), to calculate statistical measures that describe a column’s distribution, such as the Bernoulli, Pareto, or Poisson distributions.  

To use this model, connect a dataset that contains at least one column of numerical values, and choose a probability distribution to test. The module returns a data table that contains values from the specified probability function.

You can compute any of these values for the chosen probability distribution:

- cumulative distribution function (**cdf**)
- inverse cumulative distribution function (**InverseCdf**)
- probability density function (**Pdf**)

### Why is the probability distribution useful?

When you evaluate your data against a probability distribution, you are mapping column values against a set of values with known properties. By knowing whether your data corresponds to one of these well-known distributions, you might be able infer other properties of your data. In general, you can get better predictions from a model when you can identify the distribution that fits the data best.

The question of which probability distribution function to use depends on the data and the variables that are being measured. For example, some distributions are designed to describe probabilities of discrete values; others are intended for use only with continuous numerical variables.  For some distributions, you must also know in advance an expected mean, degrees of freedom, and so forth. For details, see [Supported Probability Distributions](#bkmk_SupportedDist)

## How to configure Evaluate Probability Function

+ All options change depending on the type of probability distribution you want to compute. If you change the probability distribution method, other selections you might have made are reset. 

    Therefore, be sure to choose the **Distribution** option first!
 
+ The dataset used as input should contains numerical data. Other types of data are ignored.

+ For each analysis, you can apply a single probability distribution method. To compute a different probability distribution, add a separate instance of the module for each distribution you intend to test.


1. Add the [Evaluate Probability Function](evaluate-probability-function.md) module to your experiment. You can find this module in the [Statistical Functions](statistical-functions.md) category in Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic).  

2. Connect a dataset that contains at least one column of numbers. 

3.  Use the **Distribution** option to select the kind of probability distribution that you want to calculate.  See [Supported Probability Distributions](#bkmk_SupportedDist) for a list of options and their required arguments.
  
4.  Set any parameters that are required by the distribution.  
  
5.  Choose one of three statistics to create: the cumulative distribution function (**cdf**), inverse cumulative distribution function (**InverseCdf)**, or Probability density function (**pdf**).

    See the [Technical notes](#bkmk_Notes) section for [definitions](#bkmk_Definitions).
  
6. Use the column selector to choose the columns over which to compute the selected probability distribution.

    - All the columns you select must have a numerical data type. 
    
    - The range of data in the column must also be valid, given the selected probability function. Otherwise, an error or NaN result may occur. 
    
    - For sparse columns, any values that correspond to background zeros will not be processed.  
 
7. Use the **Result mode** option to specify how to output the results. You can replace column values with the probability distribution values, append the new values to the dataset, or return only the probability distribution values.  
  
8. Run the experiment, or right-click the [Evaluate Probability Function](evaluate-probability-function.md) module and click **Run selected**.   

### Results

The following table contains a example of results, using the **Append** option, on a single temperature column from the **Forest Fires** sample dataset. 

|temp|StandardNormal.Cdf(temp)|StandardNormal.Pdf(temp)|FFisher.cdf(temp|FFisher.cdf(temp|
|------|------|------|------|------|
|8.2|1|1|0.984774|0.004349|
|18|1|1|0.997896|0.000311|
|14.6|1|1|0.996352|0.000648|
|8.3|1|1|0.985201|0.004187|
11.4|1|1|0.993147|0.001502|

The headings of the generated columns contain the probability distribution that was used.

If you are not sure which probability distribution is likely to suit your data, you can create a quick chart of cumulative distribution and probability density for any numeric column. 

1. Right-click the dataset or module output, and select **Visualize**. 
2. Select the column of interest, and in the **Histogram** pane, select **cumulative distribution** or **probability density**. 
3. A chart of the distribution, like the following, is superimposed on the histogram representing the data.

##  <a name="bkmk_Notes"></a> Technical notes  

This section contains implementation details, tips, and answers to frequently asked questions.

### Implementation details

This module supports all distributions that are provided in the open source MATH.NET Numerics library. For more information, see the documentation for the [Math.Net.Numerics.Distribution](https://numerics.mathdotnet.com/api/MathNet.Numerics.Distributions/index.htm) library.  
  
 Right-tailed and two-tailed distributions appear as separate distributions, not as parameterized versions of base distributions. The current behavior is to preserve compatibility with Excel.  

### <a name ="bkmk_Definitions"></a> Definitions

This module supports calculating any of these values for the specified distribution:

+ **cdf**, or the _cumulative distribution function_  

    Returns the probability for a compound event, defined as the sum of ocurrences when the random variable takes a value smaller than some specific value x. 
    
    In other words, it answers the question: "How common are samples that are less than or equal to this value?" 
    
    This function can be used with both continuous and discrete numeric variables. 
  
+ **InverseCdf**, or the _inverse cumulative distribution function_  

    Returns the value associated with a specific cumulative probability value (cdf). 
    
    In other words, it answers the question: "What is the value of x at which the cdf function returns the cumulative probability y?" 
  
+ **pdf**, or the _probability density function_ 

    Describes the relative likelihood for a random variable to be a specific value. 
    
    In other words, it answers the question: "How common are samples at exactly this value?"
