# Permutation Feature Importance
*Computes the permutation feature importance scores of feature variables given a trained model and a test dataset*  
  
 Category: [Feature Selection Modules](feature-selection-modules.md)  
  
## Module overview

This article describes how to use the [Permutation Feature Importance](permutation-feature-importance.md) module in Azure Machine Learning Studio, to compute a set of feature importance scores for your dataset. You use these scores to help you determine the best features to use in a model.

In this module, feature values are randomly shuffled, one column at a time, and the performance of the model is measured before and after. You can choose one of the standard metrics provided to measure performance.

The scores that the module returns represent the **change** in the performance of a trained model, after permutation. Important features are usually more sensitive to the shuffling process, and will thus result in higher importance scores. 

This article provides a good general overview of permutation feature importance, its theoretical basis, and its applications in machine learning: [Permutation feature importance](http://blogs.technet.com/b/machinelearning/archive/2015/04/14/permutation-feature-importance.aspx)  

## How to use Permutation Feature Importance

To generate a set of feature scores requires that you have an already trained model, as well as a test dataset.  
  
1.  Add the **Permutation Feature Importance** module to your experiment. You can find this module in the **Feature Selection** category. 
  
2.  Connect a trained model to the left input. The model must be a regression model or classification model.  
  
3.  On the right input, connect a dataset, preferably one that is different from the dataset used for training the model. This dataset is used for scoring based on the trained model, and for evaluating the model after feature values have been changed.  
  
4.  For **Random seed**, type a value to use as seed for randomization. If you specify 0 (the default), a number is generated based on the system clock.
  
     A seed value is optional, but you should provide a value if you want reproducibility across runs of the same experiment.  
  
5.  For **Metric for measuring performance**, select a single metric to use when computing model quality after permutation.  
  
     Azure Machine Learning Studio supports the following metrics, depending on whether you are evaluating a classification or regression model:  
  
    -   **Classification**
    
        Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Average Log Loss  
  
    -   **Regression**
    
        Precision, Recall, Mean Absolute Error , Root Mean Squared Error, Relative Absolute Error, Relative Squared Error, Coefficient of Determination  
  
     For a more detailed description of these evaluation metrics, and how they are calculated, see [Evaluate](machine-learning-evaluate.md).  
  
6.  Run the experiment.  
  
7.  The module outputs a list of feature columns and the scores associated with them, ranked in order of the scores, descending.

##  Technical notes

This section provides implementation details, tips, and answers to frequently asked questions.

### How does this compare to other feature selection methods?

Permutation feature importance works by randomly changing the values of each feature column, one column at a time, and then evaluating the model. 

The rankings provided by permutation feature importance are often different from the ones you get from [Filter Based Feature Selection](filter-based-feature-selection.md), which calculates scores **before** a model is created. 

This is because permutation feature importance doesnâ€™t measure the association between a feature and a target value, but instead captures how much influence each feature has on predictions from the model.
