# Time Series

This article describes the modules in Azure Machine Learning Studio that are specifically designed for working with time series data.

If you need help determining whether you need an algorithm specially for time series, or another type of algorithm, see these resources:

- [Machine learning algorithm cheat sheet for Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/machine-learning-algorithm-cheat-sheet/)

- [How to choose Azure Machine Learning algorithms for clustering, classification, or regression](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/machine-learning-algorithm-choice/)

## Time series modules

Azure Machine Learning Studio provides the following module for analyzing time series:

- [Time Series Anomaly Detection](time-series-anomaly-detection.md)

Additionally, you can use the following modules to perform custom time series analyses, by using the R or Python languages.

- [Execute R Script](execute-r-script.md)

- [Execute Python Script](execute-python-script.md)
