# Time Series

[!INCLUDE [ML Studio (classic) retirement](../includes/machine-learning-studio-classic-deprecation.md)]

This article describes the modules in Machine Learning Studio (classic) that are specifically designed for working with time series data.

[!INCLUDE [studio-ui-applies-label](../includes/studio-ui-applies-label.md)]

If you need help determining whether you need an algorithm specially for time series, or another type of algorithm, see these resources:

- [Machine learning algorithm cheat sheet for Microsoft Machine Learning Studio (classic)](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/machine-learning-algorithm-cheat-sheet/)

- [How to choose Machine Learning algorithms for clustering, classification, or regression](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/machine-learning-algorithm-choice/)

## Time series modules

Machine Learning Studio (classic) provides the following module for analyzing time series:

- [Time Series Anomaly Detection](time-series-anomaly-detection.md)

Additionally, you can use the following modules to perform custom time series analyses, by using the R or Python languages.

- [Execute R Script](execute-r-script.md)

- [Execute Python Script](execute-python-script.md)
